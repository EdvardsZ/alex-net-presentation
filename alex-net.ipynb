    "# ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "* ML machine methods of that time work well for relatvely small datasets. ( NORB, Caltech, Cifar )\n",
    "* Until very recently larger datasets emerge like ImageNet, LabelMe\n",
    "* Existing methods do not work well on these large datasets\n",
    "* To learn about thousands of objects of millions of images a model with large learning capacity is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNN's before this:\n",
    "* CNN's have much fewer parameters so they are easier to train\n",
    "* CNN's good performance for the number of parameters they have.\n",
    "* Expensive to apply to large scale images, because there is no effective implementation.\n",
    "* Highly optimized GPU implementation provided shown in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific contributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Achieved at that time best results on subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012\n",
    "* One of the largest conventional neural networks at that time.\n",
    "* Highly optimized GPU implementation for CNNs.\n",
    "* Number of new and unusual features of network which improve the result.\n",
    "* Techniques to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "* Final network consists of five convolutional and three fully connected layers.\n",
    "* Fully utilized 2x Nvidia GTX 580 3GB GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Large dataset with many labeeeeeels\n",
    "\n",
    "## The architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pinecone-image.png\" alt=\"Architecture diagram\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are novel or unusual features of this netork described by the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU Nonlinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"overflow: auto;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"relu.png\" alt=\"ReLU diagram\" width=\"300\" style=\"float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* AlexNet popularized the use of ReLus for Deep CNNs\n",
    "* Trains faster, which was demonstraded on CIFAR Dataset.\n",
    "* Contrast with prior work:\n",
    "    * Previous works used instead: $ f (x) = tanh(x)$ or $f (x) = (1 + e^{−x})^{−1}$, or $(x)=|tanh(x)|$\n",
    "    * Focused on regularization instead of fitting large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training on 2 GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "* GPUs had ~ 3gb memory which limits the size of networks\n",
    "* The network was split into two gpus\n",
    "* GPUs communicate only in certain layers, half parameters on each GPU.\n",
    "* Faster to train than on one GPU\n",
    "* Made use of NVIDIA CUDA framework\n",
